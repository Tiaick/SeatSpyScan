# SeatSpyScan
Manually triggered spy-check tool for EVE Online SeAT. Allows directors to analyze a character and all linked alts for potential espionage indicators (wallet connections, assets, corp history, network anomalies) on demand — fully ad hoc, with no database persistence and results stored only temporarily in cache or the browser.
